aethyr_agent is a Rails implementation of an Ubuntu linux agent. It provides the ability to automatically discover the inventory assets of a linux host and construct a configuration database. A web interface is provided for browsing the database. The agent is intended to act as an interface between the aethyr AWS management application (see http://github.com/troystribling/aethyr/tree/master) and the machine instance.

build inventory database

  rake aethyr:inventory:all

Some shell commands used in inventory collection are only supported by Debian distributions
